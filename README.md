# How I See My Work
- I believe that technologies work best when used for the cases they were designed for. 
  Redux / RxJS is not an answer for everything, neither is local state and Context API. 
  Love to evaluate new tools and approaches to see whether and how they fit in the product development process and what value they can bring.  
- Strong understanding of why unit / integration/ snapshot tests are important, when to use and what to cover.
- Embraced React hooks and declarative approach that comes with them early on. Understand the drawbacks and caveats too.
- Use Storybook daily and understand its benefits over Styleguidist. On recent projects stories are also used for snapshot testing.
- Being a strong believer in teamwork myself, I also know that team responsibility doesn’t mean no personal responsibility.
  Ready to grow in non-technical areas.
- Able to present what has been done in recent sprint in a manner that all parties can understand.
  Put emphasis on where implemented changes are standing in terms of product value and release schedule. 
- 2+ years’ experience of working fully remotely proved to have no impact on productivity and delivery schedule.
  Nevertheless, I value being able to meet with colleagues in the office.
- Understand that Agile is not about just sprints, standups and other ceremonies.
- Encourage UX / designers to save their time doing pixel-perfect mockups. Instead, let's come up with patterns / design systems
  that we can use as a dictionary to communicate core business values and ideas behind every page / feature in a more productive way.
  If it is easier to make a prototype on the front-end side and then work out from there - let’s do it.
- Document source code, add comprehensive description in Confluence for every implemented feature. 
  It takes time but it pays off in the long term.
- Honest about what I don’t know. I will not give any estimations or promises if I’m not experienced in the subject. 
  But I’m going to let you know when I’ll be ready to do that.
- Understand the importance of introducing things like coding style guide, linting, formatting and 
  other practices early in the project lifecycle and making sure all team members follow them consistently.
- Understand that small things do matter. Starting from naming function, variables, routes and API endpoints
  to text wording, consistent language, truncations, paddings, responsiveness etc.
- Good understanding of UX principles. Participate in customer interviews on a regular basis.
